Crypto Art is a rising art movement that associates digital artworks with non-fungible asset tokens. It draws its origins from conceptual art, sharing the immaterial and distributive nature of artworks, the tight blending of artworks with currency and the rejection of conventional art market and institutions. Similar to traditional artwork, the concept allows you to buy, sell and trade digital goods as if they were physical. Collectors of Crypto Art are overwhelmed with choices, reason why matching consumers with the most appropriate artworks is the key to enhancing user satisfaction. Can you suggest an artwork to an art collector?
